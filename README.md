# Background
AtliQ Hardware operates in a competitive industry, manufacturing and selling electronic products to major customers like Croma, Amazon, and Flipkart. As competition intensifies and market demands fluctuate, providing competitive pricing through customer-specific discounts has become a vital strategy to retain business and grow market share. However, offering discounts without a clear understanding of their impact on profitability poses significant risks.

# Project Objective
The tool enables the sales team to:
- Evaluate Discount Requests: Calculate the impact of customer-specific discounts on revenue and profitability.
- Optimize Profit Margins: Adjust discount rates to ensure that sales targets and profitability margins are met.
- Scenario Analysis: Simulate Best Case, Realistic, and Worst Case financial outcomes for informed decision-making.

# Key Features:
- **Sales Targets Alignment**:
  - The tool allows the sales team to evaluate discounts against set targets, ensuring that any discounts offered will still enable the company to meet its revenue and gross margin goals.

- **Discount Impact Evaluation**:
  - For any proposed discount (e.g., 12.5% for Croma), the tool calculates the impact on Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and resulting profitability, allowing the team to make data-driven decisions.

- **Scenario-Based Planning**:
  - Best Case: Maximum profitability if costs are managed efficiently, and sales volumes meet expectations.
  - Realistic: Moderates profitability assumptions based on historical trends and typical market performance.
  - Worst Case: Assesses the potential downside, helping the team prepare for unfavorable market conditions.

- **Parameter Flexibility**:
  - Sales units, invoice sales, COGS, and gross margin targets can be adjusted for each customer or product, providing flexibility for tailored decision-making.
